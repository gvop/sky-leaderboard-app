Unattended Coding Test


For this project I have used node.js in the back end and jQuery, HTML and CSS in the front end.  After the XML file is uploaded the date is being stored in a MongoDB database.  

As far as the testing went - I really enjoyed making the site for you.  Being able to use various different processes and demonstrate mathematical skills in the code was a lot of fun and a nice challenge.

To run this application Node.js needs to be installed on the computer and the MongoDB database must be running.  The site was created and tested on Google Chrome, so it is advised that you look through the site on that browser.

For testing purposes there is a ‘delete all’ content at the bottom of the page for you to clear the content as and when you need to.  

I have deployed a fully functional website on Heroku.
