Unattended Coding Test

Dear sir/madam,

Please find attached my content for the Sky Academy coding test.  As you will see from the attached files I have tried to show my ability to you to produce neat and tidy code structures, while delivering the content the way that you asked for it.

I have used node.js in the back end of the system and jQuery, HTML and CSS in the front end.  After the XML file is uploaded the date is being stored in a MongoDB database.  

As far as the testing went - I really enjoyed making the site for you.  Being able to use various different processes and demonstrate mathematical skills in the code was a lot of fun and a nice challenge.

To run this application Node.js needs to be installed on the computer and the MongoDB database must be running.  The site was created and tested on Google Chrome, so it is advised that you look through the site on that browser.

For testing purposes there is a ‘delete all’ content at the bottom of the page for you to clear the content as and when you need to.  I have used Git/Github as the control management system and have made regular commits so you are able to see the coding journey there.

I have deployed a fully functional website on Heroku.

I hope you enjoy looking at the site and seeing its functionality.  I very much look forward to hearing from you regarding the outcome of this test soon.

Kind regards

Guus van Ooijen
